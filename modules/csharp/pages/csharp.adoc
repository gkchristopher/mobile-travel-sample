== Overview

=== Components

This is the high level architecture of the system that we will be
running
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/travelsampleapp-arch.png[image]

It includes the following components - - *Client Side * - Travel Mobile
App : This is a .Net app (UWP + Xamarin for iOS and Android) that is
linked with Couchbase Lite 2.0 (Developer Preview) - *Server Side * -
Couchbase Server v5.0 - Sync Gateway v1.5 - Travel Web App - Python web
app integrated with Couchbase Python SDK

For the Develop portion of the workshop, you will be developing,
building and testing the Travel Mobile App on your local machine.

For the server side components, you have three options - *Manual*: Here,
you would download and install the components on your local machine. -
*Docker (Local)*: In this case, you would install all the server
components in separate docker containers on your local machine. - *Cloud
(Rightscale)*: In this case, you can launch and connect to an instance
of the server components running on a cloud instance.

It's not required to run your development environment this way, and
advanced configurations are discussed in the Deploy section later in the
workshop - title: Pre-requisites description: | To start, it is easiest
if you run all the components on the same machine. It's not required to
run your development environment this way, and advanced configurations
are discussed in the Deploy section but it is more convenient to start a
development environment with components running locally.

[[cloud]]
Cloud
^^^^^

*NOTE:* The RightScale cloud environment is only available for
in-classroom run workshops.

Before you get started with this section, make sure your followed the
instructions link:/develop/csharp#/0/1/0[here] to download the Travel
Mobile app. Use this option to connect to a private instance of
Couchbase Server components running on Rightscale cloud environment. At
the end of this lesson, the following components will be launched in the
cloud- - Couchbase Server - Sync Gateway - Travel Web Application

NOTE: This instance will be available for you to use for the duration of
the workshop. The instance will automatically be terminated after the
workshop. Every user will have their own sandboxed instance.

* Access https://selfservice-4.rightscale.com/catalog on your browser.
* Log in with `workshop@couchbase.com` and `cbworkshop123` as the
password.
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_login.png[image]
* From the catalog of available projects, select the *Mobile Workshop
2017*, give it a name and then click *Launch*.
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_selectproject.png[image]
* Once the instance is running, You should see the state change to
"launching". It will take several minutes to launch. So be patient!
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_launching.png[image]
* Once the instance is running, You should see the state change to
"running". There are two instances - one for "Develop" and one for
"Deploy". We are only interested in the "Develop" option.
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/rightscale_running.png[image]

Now that you have the instance up and running, you will have to edit the
mobile app so it points to the newly deployed Python Web Server and Sync
Gateway.

*Open the file* `Constants.cs`. You must update the `ServerBackendUrl`
constant which points to the Python Web Server. Replace the hostname
with the IP Address of the Rightscale instance. In the example above
that would be `54.148.83.39` but yours will be different.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Util/Constants.cs[Constants.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
public static readonly Uri ServerBackendUrl = new Uri("http://54.148.83.39:8080/api/")
----

Next, you will update the Sync Gateway endpoint.

*Open the file* `LoginModel.cs`. You must update the `SyncUrl` constant.
Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the Sync Gateway instance.
In the example above that would be `54.148.83.39` but yours will be
different.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/LoginModel.cs[LoginModel.cs]

Update the `localhost` to be the IP Address of the Sync Gateway. In my
example (from screenshot above), that would be `54.148.83.39`.

Design
------

Data Modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before diving into the document schemas, let's take a look again at the
mobile app. When you ran the mobile app in the previous lesson, you may
remember two different options were presented on the login screen:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/uwp_login_sync.png[image]

* *Sync mode*: with the user credentials provided, this user can
synchronize documents with Couchbase Server and, in turn, with other
users.
* *Guest/ Non Sync mode*: no user credentials are required for this
option. This is a local only mode.

Throughout the next lessons, you will be switching between those two
modes to test different functionalities. It's worth noting that the data
model is slightly different between those two modes. Let's review the
data model for each one.

[[sync-mode]]
Sync mode
+++++++++

Here, the application communicates with Couchbase Server (via Sync
Gateway). The documents stored in the Couchbase Server bucket have the
following types:

* `airline`
* `airport`
* `hotel`
* `route`
* `landmark`
* `user`

Except for the *user* document (right on the diagram below), most of the
documents are static/semi-static in nature.

image:https://cl.ly/40330Z0M1k3F/models.png[image]

[[guestnon-sync-mode]]
Guest/Non Sync mode
+++++++++++++++++++

In guest mode, the mobile app creates a new database for the anonymous
user. It is an empty database for storing the list of bookmarked hotels
locally.

It is conceivable that in a real-world application, a user of the Travel
Sample Mobile app may be interested in browsing for hotels in specific
locations meeting specific search criteria without having to actually
sign up. They could bookmark these hotels and later add them to their
trip reservations. These bookmarked hotels could also be shared with
other users, for instance with the user making the trip bookings.

In guest mode, the Couchbase Lite database hosts the following types of
documents:

* `bookmarkedhotels`
* `hotel`

image:https://cl.ly/2l0118183p11/guest-model.png[image]

[[document-types]]
Document Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike tables, in Couchbase, all the documents are stored in the same
namespace. So you typically use an additional property to differentiate
between each entity. Let’s call it "type".
image:https://cl.ly/1w2D1Z2J0p47/document-types.png[image]

[[try-it-out-8]]
Try it out
++++++++++

* Log into the "Admin Console" of Couchbase Server with same
Administrator credentials you used during installation
* Select the "buckets" option from menu on left
* Click on "Documents" under the travel-sample bucket
* Search for document with ID "hotel_10025"
* Verify that the "type" property of the document is "hotel"

[[document-keyid]]
Document Key/ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every document in Couchbase is associated with a unique key that must be
provided by the user when the document is created. The key is the unique
identifier of the document and can take any format. However, it is
recommended that you give it a value that provides some context about
the contents of the document. For instance, in the travel app data set,
the document Key/ID is of the format `{doc.type}_{alphanumeric_string}`.
Here `{doc.type}` provides some context of the purpose of the document
and in combination with the `{alphanumeric_string}`, it uniquely
identifies the string. The document Key will be listed as “ID” on
Couchbase Server admin console. The key is also referred to as the
Document ID.

image:https://cl.ly/0K3V1q3m3K1Z/admin-ui.png[image]

[[try-it-out-9]]
Try it out
++++++++++

* Log into the "Admin Console" of Couchbase Server with appropriate
Administrator credentials you created during installation
* Select the "buckets" option from the menu on the left
* Click on "Documents" under the travel-sample bucket
* Search for document with ID "airline_137"
* Verify that the "callsign" property of the document is "AIRFRANS"

[[document-_id]]
Document _id
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When Sync Gateway processes a document, it adds relevant metadata to the
document. The metadata includes an "_id" property that corresponds to
the document ID. You will see this property if you query for the
document via the the Sync Gateway REST API.

[source,json]
----
{
        "_id": "airline_137",
        "_rev": "1-b4e60280a1a0e3d46efad7bfd0e2068c",
        "callsign": "AIRFRANS",
        "country": "France",
        "iata": "AF",
        "icao": "AFR",
        "id": 137,
        "name": "Air France",
        "type": "airline"
}
----

Mobile App Developers using Couchbase Lite should typically never have
to directly read or write the _id property. You would query the
meta().id field to fetch the document ID. We will learn more about this
in our lesson on Queries.

[[try-it-out-10]]
Try it out
++++++++++

* Confirm that the sync gateway is running
* Run the following `curl` command on your terminal. If you used cloud
install, replace `localhost` with the IP Address of the Sync Gateway
cloud instance in command below. The Authorization credentials
correspond to a pre-defined "admin" user . We will learn more about user
configuration in the link:/develop/csharp#/2/2/1[Access Control] section
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:4984/travel-sample/airline_137 -H 'authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ='
----
* Confirm that "_id" property in the JSON response is "airline_137"

MVVM Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Model-View-ViewModel pattern
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In our app, we follow the MVVM pattern, which decouples the retrieval of
data, view logic, and presentation into three distinct areas.

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/master/content/assets/uwp_mvvm.png[image]

[[model]]
Model

The model provides and stores the internal data. In our travel app, for
simplicity, we use standard data types of `Dictionary` and `Array` to
represent the data. In a real application, one would use a custom object
to represent the model.

The app implements the following models - _Booking_ which represents a
flight reservation - _Flight_ which represents airline details -
_Airport_ which represents airport name - _Hotel_ which represents hotel
details

In addition, the `CouchbaseSession` class is used to keep state through
multiple pages.

[[view]]
View

In the Travel app, the `ContentPage` class represents the "view" in
MVVM. It handles user input and forwards requests to the VIew Model. It
updates the UI based on response from the View Model.

The app implements the following Views - _LoginPage_ which represents
the login UI - _BookmarkedHotelsPage_ which represents the UI that lists
bookmarked hotels - _FlightBookingsPage_ which represents the flight
reservations UI - _HotelsListPage_ which represents the UI that lists
hotels - _HotelDetailsPage_ which represents the UI that lists hotel
details

[[view-model]]
View Model

The View Model acts as the intermediary between the View and the Model.
It is responsible for interacting with the model and updating it's state
to indicate how the view should present itself. There is one view model
per view and is named according to the view

* _LoginViewModel_
* _BookmarkedHotelsViewModel_
* _FlightBookingsViewModel_
* _HotelsListViewModel_
* _HotelDetailsViewModel_

The Basics
^^^^^^^^^^

[[create-a-database]]
Create a Database
+++++++++++++++++

There is no limit to how many databases can be created or opened on the
device. You can think of a database as a namespace for documents and
several databases can be used in the same app (one database per user of
the app is a common pattern).

The snippet below creates an empty database for a given user in a
directory with the same name as the username.

*Open the file* `LoginModel.cs`. We will review the
`Task<CouchbaseSession> StartSessionAsync(string username, string password)`
method.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/LoginModel.cs#L54[LoginModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
public async Task<CouchbaseSession> StartSessionAsync(string username, string password) {
    ...
}
----

We create a folder for the user database if one does not exist and
specify that as the database `Directory` in the `DatabaseConfiguration`
object. Note the use of the service provider to find the default
directory for the platform.

[source,csharp]
----
var options = new DatabaseConfiguration();

// Borrow this functionality from Couchbase Lite
var defaultDirectory = Service.Provider.GetService<IDefaultDirectoryResolver>().DefaultDirectory();
var userFolder = Path.Combine(defaultDirectory, username);
if (!Directory.Exists(userFolder)) {
        Directory.CreateDirectory(userFolder);
}

options.Directory = userFolder;
----

The Couchbase Lite Database is created with specified name and
`DatabaseConfiguration` object

* Build and Run the Travel Sample Mobile App
* On Login screen select “Proceed as Guest” option.
* This will log you into app in Guest Mode. Signing in as Guest will
create a new empty database for “guest” account if one does not exist
* Confirm that you see the “Bookmarked Hotels” page. It will be empty
the very first time.
* title: Create and Update a Document description: | Bookmarked hotels
are persisted in a separate document with `type` of `bookmarkedhotels`.

The first time a hotel is bookmarked, the `bookmarkedhotels` document is
created with the document ID of that hotel document in the `hotels`
property. The hotel's information is persisted in a separate `hotels`
type document.

Subsequently, every time a hotel is bookmarked, the process repeats.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel1",
    "name": "San Francisco Hotel",
    "address": "123, Park Street, San Francisco"
}

{
    "type": "bookmarkedhotels",
    "hotels": ["hotel1", "hotel2"]
}
----

*Open the file* `HotelListModel.cs`. We will review the
`void ToggleBookmark(HotelListCellModel hotel)` method.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/HotelListModel.cs#L90[HotelListModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
public void ToggleBookmark(HotelListCellModel hotel) {
        ...
}
----

Fetch the document of type `bookmarkedhotels`. Don't worry too much
about how you query for document of specific type from the database. We
will examine `queries` in a future lesson.

Create document of type `bookmarkedhotels` if one does not exist.

[source,csharp]
----
using (var document = UserSession.FetchGuestBookmarkDocument()?.ToMutable()) {
    var doc = document;
    if (document == null) {
            ...

            doc = new MutableDocument(new Dictionary<string, object> {["type"] = "bookmarkedhotels"});
    }
----

Next, add the ID of the passed hotel to the current list of bookmarked
hotel Ids from the `hotels` property of the `bookmarkedhotels` document,
or remove it based on the current action.

[source,csharp]
----
var bookmarked = doc.GetArray("hotels") ?? new MutableArray();
if (hotel.IsBookmarked) {
        // Remove the bookmark
        for (int i = 0; i < bookmarked.Count; i++) {
                if (bookmarked[i].ToString() == hotel.Source["id"] as string) {
                        bookmarked.RemoveAt(i);
                        break;
                }
        }
} else {
            bookmarked.Add(hotel.Source["id"] as string);
}

doc.Set("hotels", bookmarked);
UserSession.Database.Save(doc);
----

Persist the hotel information as separate documents of type `hotels` (or
delete it if this is a bookmark removal). First, determine if the
document with specified hotel Id already exists. If so, update it with
the selected hotel details. If not, create a new hotel document.

[source,csharp]
----
// Add the hotel details document
if (hotel.Source["id"] is string id) {
        using (var detailDoc = UserSession.Database.GetDocument(id).ToMutable() ?? new MutableDocument(id)) {
                detailDoc.Set(hotel.Source.ToDictionary(x => x.Key, x => x.Value));
                UserSession.Database.Save(detailDoc);
        }

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A document can be deleted using the `Delete` method. This operation
actually creates a new `tombstoned` revision in order to propagate the
deletion to other clients.

*Open the file* `BookmarkedHotelModel.cs`. We will review the
`public void RemoveBookmark(HotelListCellModel bookmark)` method.

[[access-control]]
Access Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this lesson you’ll be introduced to Sync Gateway, our secure web
gateway. The Couchbase Sync Gateway is an Internet-facing
synchronization mechanism that exposes a web interface which provides -
Data Synchronization and Routing - Authorization and Access Control

In this chapter, we will focus on Authorization and Access Control. We
will discuss Data Synchronization and Routing in the
link:/develop/csharp#/2/3/0[Sync] chapter.

In the "Installation" guide, we walked you through the steps to launch
Sync Gateway with a specific config file. The Sync Gateway configuration
file determines the runtime behavior of Sync Gateway.

Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located at
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json.

* The `users` section defines the hardcoded list of users who are
granted access. It includes the "demo" user that we created via the
Travel Web App in the "User Management" section. A "tester" and "admin"
user is also configured. Note that in a real world app, when a user
registers via the web app, the web app would use the Sync Gateway REST
API to dynamically create the user.
+
[source,javascript]
----
 "users":{
    "admin": {"password": "password", "admin_channels": ["*"]},
    "demo": {"password": "password"},
    "tester": {"password": "password"}
}
----
* The `sync function` in the config file is a JavaScript function which
implements the access control logic. The `access` method is used to
grant the current user access to specific channel. We will discuss
channels in detail in the link:/develop/csharp#/2/3/0["Sync"] section.
For now, it is sufficient to note that documents are associated with
channel(s). So access to a document is controlled by controlling the
access rights to a channel.

[source,javascript]
----
    // Give user read access to channel
    if (!isDelete()) {
    // Deletion of user document is essentially deletion of user
    access(username,"channel." + username)
}

[[channelsdata-routing]]
Channels/Data Routing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the lesson on link:/csharp#/2/2/1[Access Control] we discussed how
the Couchbase Sync Gateway supports Authorization and Access Control
functions. In this lesson we discuss how it can be used for Data
Synchronization and Routing.

A Sync Gateway configuration file determines the runtime behavior of
Sync Gateway, including server configuration and the database or set of
databases with which a Sync Gateway instance can interact.

* Sync Gateway uses channels to make it easy to share a database between
a large number of users and control access to the database.
Conceptually, a channel could be viewed as a tag. Every document in the
database belongs to a set of channels, and a user is granted appropriate
access a set of channels. A channel is used to
** Partition the data set
** Authorize users to access documents.
** Minimize the amount of data synced down to devices.

In the "Installation" guide, we walked you through the steps to launch
Sync Gateway with a specific config file. Open the
sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located at
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json.
It includes the `sync function` which is a JavaScript function whose
source code is stored in the Sync Gateway's database configuration file.

[source,javascript]
----
/* Routing */
// Add doc to the user's channel.
channel("channel." + username);
----

[[xattrs]]
XAttrs
^^^^^^

Before you begin this lesson, confirm that you have the Sync Gateway up
and running by following the instructions in the
link:/develop/csharp#/0/4/0["Installation"] section.

Starting with Sync Gateway 1.5 and Couchbase Server 5.0, mobile and
server/web applications now have the ability to read and write to the
same bucket. It is an opt-in feature can be enabled in the Sync Gateway
configuration file.

Prior to 1.5, sync metadata used by the Sync Gateway for replication
with mobile clients was included within the documents as part of the
`_sync` property. In 1.5, the sync metadata is moved into the Extended
Attributes or XAttrs associated with the document.

This can be enabled through a configuration setting in the sync gateway
config file Open the sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json file located
at
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/sync-gateway-config-travelsample.json

[[replication]]
Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase Lite
synchronize database changes with the remote (server) database.

* Pull Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase
Lite download database changes from the remote (server) source database
to the local target database
* Push Replication is the process by which clients running Couchbase
Lite upload database changes from the local source database to the
remote (server) target database

Couchbase Mobile 2.0 introduces a brand new replication protocol which
is implemented over the BLIP messaging protocol layered over WebSocket.
image:https://blog.couchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/layered.png[image]

The replication process can be “continuous” or “one shot“. - In
“Continuous” replication mode, the changes are continually synchronized
between the client and Sync Gateway.

* In “One shot” mode, the changes are synchronized once and the
connection between the client and server disconnects. When any future
changes need to be pushed up or pulled down, the client must start a new
replication.

*Open the file* `LoginModel.cs`. We will review the method
`StartReplication(string username, string password, Database db)`

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/LoginModel.cs#L103[LoginModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
private Replicator StartReplication(string username, string password, Database db)
    ...
}
----

First, Do some checks to confirm the validity of the user credentials

[source,csharp]
----
if (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(username) || String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(password)) {
    throw new InvalidOperationException("User credentials not provided");
}
----

Create the URL of the Sync Gateway

[source,csharp]
----
var dbUrl = new Uri(SyncUrl, DbName);
----

The `ReplicatorConfiguration` is initialized with the local database and
URL of the target DB on Sync Gateway. The `ReplicatorType` in the
Replicator Config specifies the type of replication. In the code snippet
in the Travel app, it is `PushAndPull` indicating that both push and
pull replication is enabled. The `Continuous` mode is set to `true` in
the Travel app.

[source,csharp]
----
var config = new ReplicatorConfiguration(db, dbUrl) {
    ReplicatorType = ReplicatorType.PushAndPull,
    Continuous = true,
    ...
};
----

The Replicator is configured with relevant authentication credentials.
In the Travel app, the list of users that are permitted access is
configured in the Sync Gateway configuration file as discussed in the
link:/develop/csharp#/2/2/1[Access Control] section

[source,csharp]
----
var config = new ReplicatorConfiguration(db, dbUrl) {
        ...
        Authenticator = new BasicAuthenticator(username, password),
        ...
};
----

The Replicator is configured to only pull from current user's channels.
The list of channels that the user has access to is defined in the Sync
Gateway configuration file as discussed in the
link:/develop/csharp#/2/3/0[Channels/ Data Routing] section

[source,csharp]
----
var config = new ReplicatorConfiguration(db, dbUrl) {
        ...
        Channels = new[] {$"channel.{username}"}
};
----

The Replicator is initialized with the specified configuration

[source,csharp]
----
var repl = new Replicator(config);
----

A change listener callback block is registered to listen for replication
changes. Every time, there is a push or pull change, the callback is
invoked.

[source,csharp]
----
repl.StatusChanged += (sender, args) =>
{
        var s = args.Status;
        Debug.WriteLine(
                $"PushPull Replicator: {s.Progress.Completed}/{s.Progress.Total}, error {args.LastError?.Message ?? "<none>"}, activity = {s.Activity}");
};

----

Start the Replication

Pre-built database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[starting-with-prebuilt-database]]
Starting with Prebuilt Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, you will learn how to bundle a pre-built Couchbase Lite
database in an application. It can be a lot more efficient to bundle
static or semi-static content database in your application and install
it on the first launch. Even if some of the content changes on the
server after you create the app, the app's first pull replication will
bring the database up to date. Here, you will use a pre-built database
that contains only airport and hotel documents. The code below moves the
pre-built database from the bundled location to the platform default
directory defined by Couchbase.

*Open the file* `LoginModel.cs` and navigate to the `StartSessionAsync`
method.

This method first checks if a database file already exists. If it
doesn't exist it loads the database according to the logic for the
platform (UWP from the Assets folder, iOS from the main bundle, Android
from Assets)

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/LoginModel.cs#L54[DatabaseManager.csharp]

[source,csharp]
----
 if (!Database.Exists(DbName, userFolder)) {
        // Load prebuilt database to path
        var copier = Service.Provider.GetService<IDatabaseSeedService>();
        await copier.CopyDatabaseAsync(userFolder);

        db = new Database(DbName, options);

Query
~~~~~

[[overview-2]]
Overview
^^^^^^^^

Couchbase Lite 2.0 includes support for N1QL like query interface.
Database can be queried by constructing a query using a Query builder
and then executing that query.

The Query interface in Couchbase Lite 2.0 is poweful and includes
support for the following among others - Pattern Matching - Regex
Matching - Math Functions - String Manipulation Functions - Aggregate
Functions - Grouping - Joins (within single database) - Sorting -
NilOrMissing properties

[[implementation-pattern]]
Implementation Pattern
++++++++++++++++++++++

The `select` clause and `where` clause in the `Query` statement require
a `CouchbaseLite.Expression` type. Consider the following query

[source,csharp]
----
var hotelSearchQuery = Query
                                    .Select(SelectResult.Expression(Meta.ID),
                                                    SelectResult.Expression(Expression.Property("name")))
                                    .From(DataSource.Database(UserSession.Database))
                                    .Where(
                                            Expression.Property("description").Like("%\(descriptionStr)%")
                                         .And(Expression.Property("type").EqualTo("hotel"))
                                         .And(Expression.Property("country").EqualTo(locationStr)
                                         .Or(Expression.Property("city").EqualTo(locationStr))
                                         .Or(Expression.Property("state").EqualTo(locationStr))
                                         .Or(Expression.Property("address").EqualTo(locationStr))))

----

Often types, the same `Expression` may be required across multiple
queries. This can quickly become tedious and difficult to maintain. The
recommended pattern is to define constants corresponding to the
Expressions and to reuse them across queries.

As an example, Open the
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/AddBookingModel.cs#L43[AddBookingModel.cs]
file. This file defines some of the CouchbaseLite expressions that are
used for flight reservations

[source,csharp]
----
    private static readonly IExpression AirportNameProperty = Expression.Property("airportname");
    private static readonly ISelectResult AirportNameResult = SelectResult.Expression(AirportNameProperty);
    private static readonly IExpression FaaProperty = Expression.Property("faa");
    private static readonly IExpression IcaoProperty = Expression.Property("icao");
----

[[simple-query]]
Simple Query
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The travel app has many instances of querying the database. We will
discuss a simple example here.

*Open the file* `AddBookingModel.cs`. We will review the
`FetchMatchingAirports` method.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/AddBookingModel.cs#L124[AddBookingModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
public Airports FetchMatchingAirports(string searchStr) {
    ...
}
----

There are 3 different queries in this function body. The query that is
ran depends on the length of the search term. You can ignore this
specificity, in this section we will look at the 3rd query.

The query below *selects* the "name" property in documents *from* the
database *where* the *type* property is equal to *airport* and the
"airportname" property is equal to the search term.

[source,csharp]
----
searchQuery = Query
                .Select(AirportNameResult)
                .From(DataSource.Database(UserSession.Database))
                .Where(TypeProperty
                        .EqualTo("airport")
                        .And(AirportNameProperty
                                .Like($"{searchStr}%")));
----

Next, the query is executed using the `Run()` method. Each row in the
result will contain a single property called "airportname".

[source,csharp]

Advanced Query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we will discuss the JOIN query. JOIN Queries in
Couchbase Lite 2.0 are intra-database joins.

If you recall from the Data Modeling section, the document with a *type*
equal to "bookmarkedhotels" contains a *hotels* property which is an
array of IDs of bookmarked hotels.

[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": "hotel1",
    "name": "San Francisco Hotel",
    "address": "123, Park Street, San Francisco"
}

{
    "type": "bookmarkedhotels",
    "hotels": ["hotel1", "hotel2"]
}
----

We will review the query that fetches documents whose `_id` is included
in the "hotels" property array of the document of type
"bookmarkedhotels".

*Open the file* `BookmarkedHotelModel.cs`. We will review the
`FetchBookmarkedHotels` method.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/BookmarkedHotelModel.cs#L76[BookmarkedHotelModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
public Hotels FetchBookmarkedHotels() {
        ...
}
----

First, we instantiate two data sources which corresponds to the two
sides of the join query.

[source,csharp]
----
var bookmarkSource = DataSource.Database(UserSession.Database).As(BookmarkDbName);
var hotelsSource = DataSource.Database(UserSession.Database).As(HotelsDbName);
----

Next we use query expressions. The first one gets the `hotels` property
on the bookmarks data source. The seconds get the document ID on the
hotels data source.

[source,csharp]
----
// Static variables of the class
private static readonly IExpression HotelsProperty = Expression.Property("hotels").From(BookmarkDbName);
private static readonly IExpression HotelIdProperty = Meta.ID.From(HotelsDbName);
----

Next, we use a function expression to find document's whose `_id`
property is in the `hotels` array. And build the join expression.

[source,csharp]
----
// Static variable of the class
private static readonly IFunction JoinExpression = Function.ArrayContains(HotelsProperty, HotelIdProperty);

// In the function
var join = Join.DefaultJoin(hotelsSource).On(JoinExpression);
----

Finally, the query object uses that join expression to find all the
hotel document referenced in the "hotels" array of the bookmark
document.

[source,csharp]
----
var query = Query
        .Select(AllBookmarks, AllHotels)
        .From(bookmarkSource)
        .Joins(join)
        .Where(TypeProperty.EqualTo("bookmarkedhotels"))
----

And we use the `Run()` method to get the results back pass them on to
the view.

[source,csharp]
----
using (var results = query.Execute()) {
            foreach (var result in results) {
                    bookmarkedHotels.Add(result.GetDictionary(HotelsDbName).ToDictionary(x => x.Key, x => x.Value));
            }
}

Full Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Couchbase Lite 2.0 now supports Full Text Search (FTS). FTS is
accomplished using the `match` query. FTS matches are case-insenstive.
In the Travel App, the FTS query is against local pre-built
"travel-sample" database.

In order to do FTS queries, an FTS index must be created.

*Open the file* `LoginModel.cs`. We will review the method
`CreateDatabaseIndexes`. This code snippet creates an FTS index on the
property named `description`.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/LoginModel.cs#L88-L101[LoginModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
private void CreateDatabaseIndexes(Database db)
{
        ...

        db.CreateIndex("description",
                Index.FTSIndex(FTSIndexItem.Expression(Expression.Property("description"))));

        ...
}
----

Next you will write an FTS query that uses the index.

*Open the file* `HotelListModel.cs`. You will review the
`FetchHotelsFromLocalAsync` method.

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/mobile-travel-sample/blob/master/dotnet/TravelSample/TravelSample.Core/Models/HotelListModel.cs#L133[HotelListModel.cs]

[source,csharp]
----
private Task<Hotels> FetchHotelsFromLocalAsync(string description, string location) {
    ...
}
----

First, you will create an FTS `Expressions` using the `Match()`
operator. In this particular example, the `match` expression looks for
the `desciptionStr` value in the `description` property. This `Match`
expression is logically ANDed with an `EqualTo` comparison expression
which looks for the `location` in the `country`,`city`,`state` or
`address` properties. This expression is then used in the `Where` clause
of the query the usual way.

[source,csharp]
----
IExpression descExp = null;
if (!String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(description)) {
        descExp = DescriptionProperty.Match(description);
}


var locationExp = CountryProperty.Like($"%{location}%")
        .Or(CityProperty.Like($"%{location}%"))
        .Or(StateProperty.Like($"%{location}%"))
        .Or(AddressProperty.Like($"%{location}%"));

var searchExp = locationExp;
if (descExp != null) {
        searchExp = descExp.And(locationExp);
}


using (var hotelSearchQuery = Query
        .Select(SelectResult.All())
        .From(DataSource.Database(UserSession.Database))
        .Where(TypeProperty.EqualTo("hotel").And(searchExp))) {
        ...
}
----

We build the query using the different expressions from above and
transform the `ResultSet` object into a `List` object that is passed to
the `ListView`.

[source,csharp]
----
using (var results = hotelSearchQuery.Execute()) {
            var hotels = results.Select(x => x.GetDictionary(0).ToDictionary(y => y.Key, y => y.Value) as Hotel).ToList();
            return Task.FromResult(hotels);
}
